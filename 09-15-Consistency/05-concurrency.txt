Concurrency: Condition Variables Primer: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-cv.pdf

Coverage:
	* Classical synchronization with locks & condition variables
	* Using Go channels to control access to resources
	* Using a client/server model to manage concurrent access to
	  shared resources (style encouraged by Go).

We're going to come back to issues of concurrency again and
again in this class:  Ensuring correct operation when
multiple independent actors (threads, processes, computers, etc.)
are trying to use a set of shared resources at the same time.
This happens from settings ranging from a single-core CPU
to wide-area distributed systems involving millions of hosts.
Today we'll start with some of the basics with threads on a single
node, but don't be fooled - we'll be expanding upon these to
the multiple machine case in the future.  The difference between
today and those future lectures is that today, we don't have
to worry as much about independent failures:  If the computer
running a thread loses power, e.g., all of the threads will disappear.

[Instructor notes:  Convey desirable properties of mutual exclusion:
- Correctness - achieves mutex, does not deadlock, does not livelock
- Efficiency - no spinlocks that waste resources
- Fairness (often)
]

Review.  In 213, you learned the basics of concurrency. Lets recap them. 

Classical model:

Have set of threads running within an address space.  Some parts of
state are shared, some are private.  In typical application, establish
set of conventions:

* What data will be shared between threads
* How will we control access to shared data

Latter is done via various synchronization mechanisms.  In particular,
you learned about semaphores:

Integer variable x that can operated on with two operations:

x.P():
	while (x == 0) wait;
	x--

x.V():
	x++

Both operations are done atomically, meaning that all steps take place
without any intervening operations.

Special case: Binary semaphore == Mutex:

x = 1: Unlocked.  Resource is available
x = 0: Locked.  Must wait to get to resource.

Common refer to operations P = "Lock" and V = "Unlock"



Let's look at following problem:

[Instructor note:  Ask about semantics of Go channels.]

Want to create FIFO queue that supports thread-safe operations:
(Note analogy here to Go channels!  But without capacity limit.)

b.Init()
	Initialize values

b.Insert(x)
	Insert item into queue

b.Remove()
	Block until queue not empty (if necessary)
	Return element at head of queue

b.Flush()
	Clear queue

Assume that we already have a sequential implementation of a buffer.
Suppose that b represented by structure with fields:

	sb: Sequential buffer implementation
	mutex: Mutual exclusion lock


Clearly need to wrap with mutex:

b.Init():
	b.sb = NewBuf()
	b.mutex = 1


b.Insert(x):
	b.mutex.lock()
	b.sb.Insert(x)
	b.mutex.unlock()

b.Remove():
	b.mutex.lock()
	x = b.sb.Remove()  # Oops. What if sb is empty?
	b.mutex.unlock()
	return x


b.Flush():
	b.mutex.lock()
	b.sb.Flush()
	b.mutex.unlock()

What's wrong with this code?
 
Answer: If call Remove when buffer is empty, will call sb.Remove(), which is invalid.

Let's try to fix this.

Silly fix 1:

   b.Remove() 
      retry:
      b.mutex.lock()
        if !(b.sb.len() > 0) {
	    b.mutex.unlock()
            goto retry
        }
        ...

What's wrong with this?  This is a spin lock!  Wastes resources,
and no guarantee that an Insert() will ever make progress.
Inefficient and potential LIVELOCK, though eventually, it might
get through.  Not efficient.  Not necessarily correct.

Bryant & O'Hallaron, Figure 12.25 (p. 968) use semaphore "items" that
counts number of items in buffer

b.Initialize():
	b.sb = NewBuf()
	b.mutex = 1
	b.items = 0


b.Insert(x):
	b.mutex.lock()
	b.sb.Insert(x)
	b.mutex.unlock()
	b.items.V()

b.Remove():
	b.items.P()
	// This is the point of vulnerability.
	// What if someone else flushes right here?
	b.mutex.lock()
	x = b.sb.Remove()
	b.mutex.unlock()
	return x


b.Flush():
	b.mutex.lock()
	b.sb.Flush()
	b.items = 0
	b.mutex.unlock()

What's wrong?

Answer: For just Insert & Remove, this would work fine.  But Flush
messes things up.  If flush occurs at point of vulnerability in
Remove, then again find self trying to remove from empty buffer.

Fixing race condition.  How about this:
      
b.Remove():
	b.mutex.lock()
	// What if get here with an empty buffer?  We're blocking
	// any thread that could fill it.
	b.items.P()
	x = b.sb.Remove()
	b.mutex.unlock()
	return x

Answer: Avoids race, but prone to DEADLOCK: reach point where no one
is able to proceed.

In this case:

Remove when buffer is empty.  Remove gets lock.  Somewhere else, want
to Insert, but can't get past lock.

Find that it's really hard to fix.  My attempts with using binary
semaphore to indicate whether or not buffer empty failed.

(See code in code/class05/syncbuf/lbuf)


Better approach: Use CONDITION VARIABLES.

Condition variables provide a synchronization point, where one thread
can suspend until activated by another.

Condition variable always associated with a mutex.
(Must have unique mutex for given cvar.  One mutex can work with
multiple cvar's).

Assume cvar connected to mutex:

cvar.Wait():
	Must be called after locking mutex.
	Atomically: release mutex & suspend operation

	When resume, lock mutex (but maybe not right away)

cvar.Signal():
	If no thread suspended, then no-op
	Wake up (at least) one suspended thread.
	(Typically do within scope of mutex, but not required)

Code for buffer with condition variables:

b.Initialize():
	b.sb = NewBuf()
	b.mutex = 1
	b.cvar = NewCond(b.mutex)


b.Insert(x):
	b.lock()
	b.sb.Insert(x)
	b.cvar.Signal()		# Optionally: Do only when previously empty
	b.mutex.unlock()

// First Version
b.Remove():
	b.mutex.lock()
	if b.sb.Empty() {
	   b.cvar.Wait()   // Note that lock is first released & then retaken
	}
	x = b.sb.Remove()
	b.mutex.unlock()
	return x


b.Flush():
	b.mutex.lock()
	b.sb.Flush()
	b.mutex.unlock()
	
Remove isn't quite right.  Here's the problem:

cvar.wait has 3 steps:

	  Atomically { Release lock; suspend operation }

	  ...

	  Resume execution
	  // Point of vulnerability.  Small chance that someone could flush here.
	  Get lock


// Correct Version
b.Remove():
	b.mutex.lock()
	// Code looks weird.  But remember that are releasing and
	// regaining lock each time around loop.
	while b.sb.Empty() {
	   b.cvar.Wait()   // Note that lock is first released & then retaken
	}
	x = b.sb.Remove()
	b.mutex.unlock()
	return x

What the loop makes happen:

     Lock

     if !sb.empty() goto ready
     Unlock
     wait for signal
     Lock

     if !sb.empty() goto ready
     Unlock
     wait for signal
     Lock

     . . .

ready: Can safely assume that have lock & that buffer nonempty

Using Go channels

Go promotes a different view of concurrency, where set up miniature
client/server structures within a single program.  Use "channels" as
mechanism for:

1. Passing information around
2. Synchronizing goroutines
3. Providing pointer to return location (like a "callback")

Basic idea:

Can make channel of any object type:
    * Bounded FIFO queue
      c := make(chan int, 17)
      d := make(chan string, 0)
    * Insertion: c <- 21
      If channel already full, then wait for receiver.
      Then put value at end
    * Removal    s := <- d
      If channel empty, then wait for sender
      Then get first value

Note that when channel has capacity 0, then insertion & removal are a
"rendezvous"

Variations:

Capacity = 0: Synchronized send & receive

Insert           Remove
          |
    ----->|----->
          |

Capacity = 1: Token passed from sender to receiver

Insert           Remove
          +---+
    ----->|   |----->
          +---+


Capacity = n: Bounded FIFO

Insert           Remove
          +-----------------------+
    ----->|                       |----->
          +-----------------------+

Example: Use as mutex

type Mutex struct {
	mc chan int
}

// Create an unlocked mutex
func NewMutex() *Mutex {
	m := &Mutex{make(chan int, 1)}
	m.Unlock()		   # Initially, channel empty == locked
	return m
}

func (m *Mutex) Lock() {
	<- m.mc			    # Don't care about value
}

func (m *Mutex) Unlock() {
	m.mc <- 1		    # Stick in value 1.
}

How about using channel to implement concurrent buffer:

* Acts as FIFO
* Allows concurrent insertion & removal

Shortcomings:

* Size bounded when initialized.  Cannot implement bounded buffer

* No way to test for emptiness.  When read from channel, cannot put
back value at head position

* No way to flush

* No way to examine first element ("Front" operation)

Basic point:

* Channels are very low level.
* Most applications require building more structure on top of
channels.
